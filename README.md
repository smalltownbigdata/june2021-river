# Small Town Big Data: June 2021
## Wild and scenic: How the Yampa River flows

This repository contains the tutorial that accompanies [this blog post](https://www.smalltownbigdata.com/post/yampa-river-steamboat-data. 

This beginner-friendly tutorial offers an introduction to accessing USGS stream flow data directly from R using dataRetrieval, as well as creating interactive plots with Plotly. You can work in any code editor or IDE, but if you're a beginner, I recommend downloading [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). 

The data is downloaded via the code, which is available in the june2021-river.html file or at [this link](https://smalltownbigdata.github.io/june2021-river/june2021-river.html).
